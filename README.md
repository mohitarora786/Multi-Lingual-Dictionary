# Overview
# Introduction
- The project focuses on creating a Multilingual Dictionary web application where users can input an English word, and the application provides comprehensive information including syllables, pronunciation, scientific names (for nouns), images, meanings, examples, antonyms, synonyms, and translations in other languages.

# Objective
- The primary objective is to present word meanings in multiple languages with usage examples, focusing on "Hindi," "Marathi," "Tamil," and "Telugu" as target languages for the database.

# Problem Statement
- The project originated from the collaboration between Mr. Amar and Mr. Akbar for their venture, i3Tech Pvt. Ltd. They aimed to develop a dictionary application to store data related to words, meanings, translations, part-of-speech tags, syllables, pronunciations, images, scientific names, and more.

3. Add Files to Apache Folder: Copy project files to your Apache web server directory, typically named public_html or htdocs.

4. Start the Apache Server: If it's not running, start your Apache server using the appropriate command for your system (e.g., sudo systemctl start apache2 on Linux or through XAMPP/WAMP on Windows).

5. Access the Multilingual Dictionary web application in your web browser by entering the URL for your Apache server, followed by the path to your project files (e.g., http://localhost/multilingual-dictionary).
